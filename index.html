            Hello, my name is Oluwashindara Elizabeth Iborogba, but you can call
            me Lizzy. Welcome to my website. <br />
            I believe
            <strong>
              <em> healthy families birth healthy societies </em></strong
            >
            and that's why I started the
            <strong>'Mind Reformation Forum'</strong> in 2020 which currently
            has over 200 members.
            <br />
            As a relationship coach, love and mental therapist, I help people
            address critical issues affecting their lives and relationships;
            helping them gain mastery of their emotions and thus, be more
            productive. I am currently studying Psychology at the University of
            Ibadan (UI), Oyo state, Nigeria. <br />

            <h3>My New book</h3>
            <p>
              One fateful Sunday in Church after Sunday School class, a man, looking puzzled like someone who has been searching looking for answers, stood up and asked, <em>"where can one find true love? At work, in Church, at home, where?"</em> 
              The question drew laughter from almsot everyone; I didn't find it funny because I knew where that question was coming from.  This is a question on the minds of many people. Some go as far as asking if <strong>true love</strong> even exists at all.
              As a love and mental therapist, and in my experiences during counseling, I see a lot of people struggling with emotions, while some are innocently suffering from it. It's quite funny they blame everything on love. 
              What really is love? Does true love exists? Where can one find true love? How do you identify true love? You will answers to these and many more questions in the book in <em>IDENTIFYING TRUE LOVE.</em>
