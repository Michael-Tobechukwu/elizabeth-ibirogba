        <h3>My New book</h3>
        <p>
          One fateful Sunday in Church after Sunday School class, a man, looking
          puzzled like someone who has been searching looking for answers, stood
          up and asked,
          <em
            >"where can one find true love? At work, in Church, at home,
            where?"</em
          >
          The question drew laughter from almsot everyone; I didn't find it
          funny because I knew where that question was coming from. This is a
          question on the minds of many people. Some go as far as asking if true
          love even exists at all. As a love and mental therapist, and in my
          experiences during counseling, I see a lot of people struggling with
          emotions, while some are innocently suffering from it. It's quite
          funny they blame everything on love.
          <strong
            >What really is love? Does true love exists? Where can one find true
            love? How do you identify true love</strong
          >
          ? You will answers to these and many more questions in the book in
          <strong>IDENTIFYING TRUE LOVE</strong>.

                <strong>
                  Identifying true love by Elizabeth is a must read!
                </strong>
                <br />
                <q>
                  I must confess, the book is too loaded not to be needed. Kai!
                  It's a pity that the generation we live in today doesn't
                  understand what <em>love</em> truly means. They mistake crush
                  and infatuation for love. <br />
                  Elizabeth in her book listed what people term as love which is
                  not, you need to read through to understand what I'm talking
                  about. She really went deep in explaining what love is, read
                  the book to find out. It's also amazing how she shared her
                  life story of how she was entangled for years on what she
                  thought was love which wasn't. No doubt many people are also
                  under that kind of entanglement and are struggling with it all
                  the days of their life. She shared practical steps on how she
                  was free from the struggles. The template is available for
                  modelling to anyone who also want to be free in the book
                  though. She also highlighted
                  <strong>how you can identify true love</strong>. True love
                  still exist, you are the one who haven't discovered it. The
                  Amazing part of the book was when she linked it to Christ
                  demonstrating how He showed true love by dying for mankind.
                  Everyone needs to read
                  <em>Identifying true love by Elizabeth Ibirogba</em> You did a
                  Great work! More ink to your pen! God bless you.
