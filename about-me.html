          "Healthy families birth healthy societies." In lieu to this, one of
          her goals is to build a peaceful society with standard morals. She is
          a child advocate and life coach. She believes that when a
          child/teenager is well trained without being deprived of their rights
          and enlighten them with the necessary education they need for the
          different stages they experience, a health society is being built.
          Hence; her profession. She teaches in Tansol Treasures College at
          Alaguntan, Iyanapaja, Lagos State. Nigeria. She established a club for
          preteens and teenagers, tagged 'teenstalk'. She has a friendly and
          motherly relationship with the students. Some call her "our school
          mother" while others call her "the school counselor." "Having the
          right mindset plays important role in achieving greatness." As a lady
          who is passionate about achieving greatness together with anyone she
          come across with, she founded 'Mind Reformation Forum' in 2020 with
          over 200 members. It's an online platform where she teaches and
          mentors people, providing them with practical real life lessons, and
          principles to live a fulfilled and victorious life on earth.
          Oluwashindara Lizzy Ibirogba is also a relationship coach, love, and
          mental therapist. She addresses critical issues affecting people's
          relationships and proffer solutions. She understands the important of
          a stable emotion and healthy mentality in productivity. As an
          intellectual with eloquent speaking style, she has been invited as
          guest speaker on different platforms, on several occasions to counsel,
          motivate and inspire thousands of people who are passing through
          difficult situations in their love, marital and personal lives. She
          writes for Edify Network. The monthly article written by her
          'Relationship without Regret' is one of the best monthly articles so
          far. She holds National Diploma in Business Administration and
          Management from Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State. She is currently
          studying Psychology at the prestigious University of Ibadan, Oyo
          state, Nigeria. Within and outside work, she remains the same. Her
          personality inspires and motivates people around her. She is friendly
          but also a disciplinarian. Her resilience is worthy of emulation. She
          believes that nothing in the real sense is impossible, if one is
          responsible, accountable and intentional. Her lifestyle and conduct
          spells that out. She is the author of one of the best selling books;
          Identifying True Love.
