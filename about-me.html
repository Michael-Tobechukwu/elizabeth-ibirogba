        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px">
          <em>"Healthy families birth healthy societies."</em> In lieu of this,
          one of my goals is to help build a peaceful society with standard morals. I
          am a child advocate and life coach; I believe that when a
          child/teenager is well trained without being deprived of their rights
          and enlighten them with the necessary education they need for the
          different stages they experience, a health society is being built.
          <br /><br />
          I teach in <strong>Tansol Treasures College</strong> at Alaguntan,
          Iyanapaja, Lagos, Nigeria. I started a club for preteens and
          teenagers, tagged <em>'Teenstalk'</em>. I have a friendly and motherly
          relationship with my students; such that they call me "our school
          mother" or "the school counselor." <br />
          <br />
          <em
            ><strong
              >"Having the right mindset plays important role in achieving
              greatness."</strong
            ></em
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          As a lady who is passionate about achieving greatness, I founded 'Mind
          Reformation Forum' in 2020 with over 200 members currently. It's an
          online platform where I teach and mentor people, providing them with
          practical, real life lessons, and principles to live a fulfilled and
          victorious life on earth.
          <br /><br />
          As a relationship coach, love, and mental therapist, I help address
          critical issues affecting people's relationships and proffer
          solutions. I understand the importance of a stable emotion and healthy
          mentality in productivity. <br /><br />
          As an intellectual with eloquent speaking style, I have been invited
          as guest speaker on different platforms to counsel, motivate and
          inspire thousands of people who are struggling with difficult
          situations in their love, marital and personal lives. I write for
          <strong>Edify Network</strong>, the monthly article written by her
          'Relationship without Regret'. <br />
          <br />
          I currently hold a National Diploma (ND) in Business Administration
          and Management from Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State.
          <br /><br />I am currently studying Psychology at the prestigious
          University of Ibadan, Oyo state, Nigeria. I inspire and motivate
          people around me. I am friendly, but also a disciplinarian. I believe
          that nothing in the real sense is impossible, if one is responsible,
          accountable and intentional. I just launched my book,
          <strong>Identifying True Love.</strong>
